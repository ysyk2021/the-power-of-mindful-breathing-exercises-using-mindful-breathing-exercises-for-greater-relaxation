Mindful breathing exercises can also improve respiratory health by promoting deeper, more efficient breathing.

How to Practice Mindful Breathing

To practice mindful breathing, find a quiet space where you can sit or lie down comfortably. Close your eyes and bring your attention to the sensations of the breath.
