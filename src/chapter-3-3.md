Finding a comfortable space to practice mindful breathing can help reduce distractions and improve focus. Choose a quiet space where you can sit or lie down comfortably.

Guided meditations can be helpful for establishing a regular mindful breathing practice. There are many resources available online or through meditation apps that offer guided meditations specifically for mindful breathing exercises.

Cultivating a regular mindful breathing practice takes time and patience. Remember to approach your practice with a non-judgmental attitude towards yourself and any distractions that arise during your practice.

Incorporating mindful breathing exercises into daily life can also help establish a regular practice. This may involve practicing mindful breathing exercises during breaks at work, while waiting in line, or during moments of transition throughout the day.
