Mindful breathing exercises activate the body's relaxation response, which counteracts the effects of stress on the body. By bringing awareness to the present moment and observing the breath without judgment or distraction, individuals can reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety, leading to improved emotional regulation.

Additionally, practicing mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase activity in areas of the brain associated with positive emotion and decrease activity in areas associated with negative emotion.
